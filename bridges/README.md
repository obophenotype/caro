## Bridge Ontologies

Each bridge ontology can be opened in Protege. Each consists of 3 things:

 * An import to CARO
 * An import to the relevant AO
 * Equivalence axioms between CARO and the AO

These were seeded from xrefs in the various AOs. However, *this
repository is now the primary location*. AO editors can make changes
here. Contact the CARO maintainers for further instructions.
