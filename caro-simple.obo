def: "A part of a cellular organism that is either an immaterial entity or a material entity with granularity above the level of a protein complex.  Or, a substance produced by a cellular organism with granularity above the level of a protein complex." [CAROC:Brownsville2014]
comment: Following BFO, material anatomical entities may have immaterial parts (the lumen of your stomach is part of your stomach).  The granularity limit follows the limits set by the Gene Ontology on the granularity limit for GO:cellular_component. Note that substances produced by an organism (sweat, feaces, urine) do not need to be part of an organism to qualify as an anatomical structure.

comment: Note that the definition does not say 'generated exclusively by the co-ordinated expression of the organism's own genome', so this is still valid for cases where normal morphogenesis requires the actions of a facultative symbiont, or some looser dependency such as the a requirement for the presence of gut flora for normal gut development.

The last clause. "contains one or more organism substances or anatomical structures" was dropped from the definition because it was an unnecessary restriction.

comment: Except in the case of abstracted fiat boundaries such as the midline plane of an organism, all 2D anatomical entities have a 3 dimensional projection.  For example, the surface of the shell of a muscle has a distinct shape that projects into the third dimension.  Note that boundaries are 2D structures.  They have no thickness - and so can not be sites of gene expression or gene product localisation.  For this, use boundary region terms.

comment: MH: define as not part of embryo, or will not develop into embryo? MH: changed def to exclude cells so this class could be included in gross anatomical part. DOS: Changed to something that I think works for both vertebrates and invertebrates and that keeps the restriction to multicellular structures.  Old def: "Anatomical structure that is contiguous with the embryo and is comprised of portions of tissue that will not contribute to the embryo.".  One remaining question - perhaps zygote is too restrictive given that some organisms have parthenogenesis e.g. aphids?\n

comment: Not to be confused with anatomical cluster, in the FMA sense.  FMA anatomical structures are connected structures made up of heterologous parts.  For example, joints are anatomical clusters in the FMA.  The FMA definition on anatomical cluster, and the CARO1 definition that was based on it, are defined largely by exclusion.

comment: A general term for organism that is agnostic about single cell vs multi-cellular.  Note that this is a subclass of 'anatomical structure', meaning that an organism must be a connected structure. For example, if I take one plant and make a rooted cutting from a it, I now have two (clonally related) organisms.
