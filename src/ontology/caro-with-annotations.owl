In addition to the class specific comments in this documentation, the following general issues were raised in the original CARO2 google doc:

1. NOTES REGARDING ORGAN 
Organ - define in terms of type of boundary?  Bring in function too?

MH: I think so.

DOS: From FUNCARO paper:  
label: organ 
definition: “A multicellular anatomical structure that is largely delimited by a morphological boundary and has parts that collectively function in some physiological process.” 
SubClassOf: ‘multicellular anatomical structure’ 
SubClassOf: has_function some (realized_by only ‘multicellular organismal process’

2. NOTES REGARDING FUNCARO
 MH: I think in the interest of reducing confusion, we should have a caro 2.0 release that includes the funcaro stuff- I'd rather have them bundled together (can keep different namespace, slim or whatever if that is helpful, but just want the CARO2.0 file to contain the functionally defined classes).

Some excerpts form the FUNCARO paper are also in the google doc, and comments on this material.  See the google doc for more here.
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mFU72xoO7YU4_72e0_Uros-n5MD9jJGeNhKmqt4l8zw/edit#

3. For CARO 2 to succeed where the original has failed:

(a)  CARO 2 needs clear definitions made for biologically defensible reasons or to ensure good modeling practice.  The distinctions made in definitions must be readily understandable by biologists and commonly distinguishable: classification depending on criteria for which little data exists should be avoided.  
(b) CARO 2 needs formal definitions so that auto-classification by reasoners can be used in place of hand classification.
(c) CARO 2 needs built-in error checking.   If ontology editors are to stand a chance of using CARO 2  classes consistently, they need a system of automated consistency checks. In practice this means disjointness declarations and suitable domain and range constraints. It also means that they need to be importing upper ontology structures and relations rather than trying to replicate them as has generally been the case for CARO.")

AnnotationAssertion(rdfs:comment <http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CARO_0000000> "Notes: [One obvious question to ask is whether we need a root term for CARO at all?  ]

The root term defines the scope of the ontology.  In the jargon of the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO; link), anatomical entities are types of independent continuant, but what distinguishes them from other independent continuants? 

In the current version, it is sufficient to state that an independent continuant is part of an organism (or virus or viroid) in order for it to be an anatomical entity.  Note that the relationship between a material and an immaterial anatomical entity is 'part of', as is the relationship between an organism and any (portion of) organism substance.

--- OLD NOTES ---

an anatomical entity should have the class restriction of being part_of an organism. Being enclosed by the boundary of an organism seems like a necessary condition, but not a sufficient one:  If a swallowed a piece of plastic, or had a piece of shrapnel embedded in my thigh, we wouldn’t consider either to be anatomical entities.  Presumably, the genus of the FMA definition, ‘organismal continuant entity’, is meant to avoid this issue. But this is not defined by the FMA.

Certainly many, perhaps most anatomical entities are either an individual member of a biological species or a structural element of one.  But sweat, saliva and faeces can hardly be considered structural elements of anatomy, but are classified as anatomical entities by by the FMA and were intended to be covered by CARO.

We therefore suggest the following definition:
(organism or part_of some organism or derives_from some organism) and not (molecule or part_of some molecule)
The definition of derives_from in RO2005 is subjective - what portion of matter must be inherited? We might use a specific sub-relation that is more inclusive, such that only a small portion of matter be retained, such that feces, urine are anatomical, because they include some portion of matter that came from the organism, whereas a swallowed undigestible piece of plastic that passes through would not. 

MH 10.6.11. I added the class restriction that an antomical entity is part of or located in some organism or virus or virioid. This is slightly different in that it doesn't use the derived relation, and doesn't distinguish poop from the swallowed piece of plastic. It does however, include the immaterial spaces. We can consider something stronger on material anatomical entity?"^^xsd:string)

However, there is no guarantee that an organism subdivision is a connected structure.  If I slice out an abdominal segment from an adult fly, not all of the structures will form a connected whole.  We should therefore move ‘organism subdivision’ to be a sibling of ‘anatomical structure’ and ‘anatomical group’. {MJY - AGREED. Also - “primary” needs clarification- it really is meaningless in our experience.} MH: agree too. word primary there to help annotators and not really part of definition. move to comment and explain would be more helpful.

One problem here is formally defining “primary”.The key axiom is that “the mereological sum of [organism subdivision]s is the whole organism”. There may be many different ways to slice up an organism. A magician may slice up his assistant into an anterior portion and posterior portion. An aS1={ap,pp}natomist would slice up a person into thorax, abdomen and appendages. Real, i.e. S2={t,a,app}lyWe cannot mix and match, or the axiom would be violated - either all the members of S1 are subdivisions, or all the members of S2 are subdivisions, but not both.  Choice of parcelation schemes is ultimately arbitrary. My choice would be to define organism subdivision weakly, i.e. “ , organism subdivision should be relational, i.e. relative to a particular parcelation scheme.  Choice of parcellation scheme is ultimately arbitrary.  There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but the definition should make this clear.

FMA defines largely by exclusion, but based on usage it seems to mean something like 'a  connected structure made up of heterologous parts'. It is used especially where some of those parts have fiat boundaries through them - e.g. vertebrate joints - where defining the contribution of the bones involved requires fiat boundaries through those bones.  My worry is that this class could apply to almost anything, and in most cases there will be more useful classifications we could apply too.  So the result will be multiple inheritance for no obvious gain.  However, it has been so widely used that the term is likely to be maintained for the foresable future.

This leads to a need to better define or refine the treatment of 3-D shape - to perhaps reference the notion of a designed shape rather than just any shape?  ie a kidney stone has a 3-D shape, but this shape is random and not designed.

There simply too much to keep track of and it contains terms that are not defined elsewhere in CARO. For example, nowhere in CARO is there a definition of ‘multi-tissue aggregate’, or for that matter *‘organ’*.

* Comments AD: seems to be a major oversight of CARO
DOS: Not having this term was actually the result of weeks of argument (!)
MH: yeah- problem was largely that the label is used for many things, so no one could agree on it. I think it would be fine to use it, as long as we apply it given its definition.(maybe if the biologists can agree on that we can finally move forward...)*

Given this, perhaps the best we can do is look at its usage.  This shows that it has generally [Is it really majority? Check] been used for collections of **disconnected** structures.  This is most apparent for some terms of its subclass ‘anatomical system’.  For example, the zebrafish anatomy ontology has under this term:

**Comments - 'DOS: Disconnected' is quite a simple idea and not at all vague. Perhaps language is making it sound more complicated than it is.  See cartoon here for instances of connected, non-connected and non-connected clustered structures: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1viRoiV3qY2SER0nfFoky2En2ZZ0IMNtS3IDIRj7X8H8/edit **

**immune system
hematopoietic system
endocrine system**

*** Comments - MH: these were all added as group because they are disconnected. However, we all know that they can easily be classfiied by function.
DOS: Indeed, but physically, each is made up of lots of disconnected bits.***

All these terms clearly refer to disconnected systems. {How so- cells can be shared across systems, in nearly all cases I suspect they are connected at some level - MJY}  Also, for none of these would it make sense to say that it ‘has inherent 3D shape’, as stipulated in the definition of ‘anatomical structure’. {MJY- I agree - doesn’t inherent 3D shape come at a higher level with mass? everything that has mass has some definition of 3D shape?}  Is an instance of an ‘anatomical structure’ a single connected structure? I believe this was the intention,  although it is not clear from the definition.

A simpler secondary distinction for material anatomical entity would be on the basis of whether an instance is a single connected structure or a set of disconnected structures.  In BFO, this latter class corresponds to ‘scattered aggregate’.

Why is it useful to make the distinction between scattered aggregates and connected structures?  {MJY - in a “complete” ontology there is no point IMO- relations/properties of indiviudal components will provide the necessary “connect” -> i.e. they will be reasoned out/discoverable}
[One reason:  Excessive use of groups => temptation to use partonomy (limited opportunity to formalize) in place of classification (lots of ways to formalize).  E.g.- see ‘set of’ terms.]

2.  The original definition of ‘portion of organism substance’ contains the restriction that a member of this class must be a “Material anatomical entity in a gaseous, liquid, semisolid or solid state; produced by anatomical structures or derived from inhaled and ingested substances”  The cuticle of an insect certainly seems to fit this definition. It is solid and is produced by the produced by an anatomical structure, the underlying epidermis. But is also has ‘has inherent 3D shape and is generated by coordinated expression of the organism's own genome.’ So,  it makes sense to classify this an anatomical structure.  The definition of ‘organism substance’ therefore requires a negative clause.
